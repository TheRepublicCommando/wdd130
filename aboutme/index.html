    <h2>My Name Is Kaleb Glenn</h2>
    <h2>Though some call me Kilroy Glenn</h2>
    <p>Let's see, where to begin, lets start on my career path. I am hoping to become a secondary
        education teacher either in middle school or highschool. As for the courses to teach I am
        going for kinda like a multi media kinda class, or an introduction to multi media. Depending
        on the school, start a class that kinda makes a weekly announcments and do some lil skits I 
        call them. If needed I can teach english or history. I plan on becoming the best teacher every
        student wishes for when in school, not giving out to much homework, curate my lesson plan for 
        each class as needed, for example if one class have a bunch of teachers giving out a ton of 
        homework, I will plan on having a good portion of class or days where they just work on the 
        other teachers assingments, and if able help them with said assingments. Though while having
        these "free times" the students will still learn what is expected in the class, just minus the 
        stress most students bear nowadays.</p>
        <p>Lets see, currently I am working at the Marysville Washington Regal Theater. Its ok, alot better
        than other jobs i've seen and heard. Sadly not many people need logos or other digital art in 
        the area im in :( Speaking of which, onto my hobbies. Theres abunch of things I like to do, but 
        one of the main things im known for is video editing. Thats actually where I got my nickname Kilroy.
        In middle School, we had a class called Tiger Media or TM2. It was a Yearbook/Leadership/video class.
        I was part of the video class. Everymonth we would release an 20-30 min episode. Sadly I joined in 
        the middle of the school year, where it is the busiest time. That meant No one was able to teach me 
        how to edit videos. so after 2 weeks of just playing around with the editing system and teaching myself,
        I made my very first video. (It was a snickers style of commercial). After that I was able to make a short 
        2-5 min video in 2 weeks. Then it went to 1 week, then went to 2 videos everyweek, then 3, then 5.
        The videos were pretty good, considering a middle schooler did it. I was pumping out all these videos,
        and also was still able to help other people edit their videos. Keep in mind, all the videos I did, I recorded
        myself, directed, and often times acted in them. I got pretty good at making clones of myself. I did spend
        alot of time before and after school editing though. Towards the end of the year, I was given a badge
        like the teachers would have and on it my name said: Kaleb "Kilroy" Glenn. This was given to me infront of 
        the class. My teacher told everyone that I was a one man army when it came to producing videos for the class.
        Then told the Story of Kilroy. If you know the whole story of where Kilroy was here came from, you know why they 
        gave me that name. I find it funny how we had I think 2 episodes where I either made all the lil videos, or 
        edited all of them.</p>
        <p>Aside from video editing, I also do logo designs and a little bit of digital art. I also like to play games.
        Me and my friends are actually currently working on a game as well, a simulator type game, but there is story
        to it so this is going to be very interesting.</p>
