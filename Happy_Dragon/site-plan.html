        Welcome to the website of the Happy Dragon! We are so glad you could make it. If you didn’t already know, The Happy Dragon is a mix of a Cafe style and bar style. We have a variety of foods and baked goods for you to enjoy along with an assortment of Root Beers. There is no Alcohol aloud. We strive to make the Happy Dragon a family friendly place and also a safe space to hangout at.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have noticed over the years that there aren't exactly a lot of safe places for people to hangout/study at. Sure there's the public library for studying, but that’s not a good place to hangout and have fun. Then there’s home, but sometimes home is, how should I say this, complicated for some so not a great place to hangout/study at for some. To fight this, we encourage students to come hangout here where they are most welcome to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Need somewhere to work/study on a paper, you are most welcome. Need a tavern style for your D&D campaign to help set the mood for your party? COME ON OVER! Curious about some of our Root Beers? Don’t be shy, if you want we can see what kind of root beer would best suit you, maybe even make a special “concoction” if you dare.
