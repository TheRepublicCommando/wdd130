                <h2 id="happyT">Who are we?</h2>
                <p id="happytext">For those who dont already know us, my name is Kaleb, and my partner in crime is Rileah.
                    We both love cooking and gaming. Rileah is more on the baking side of things while I am
                    more on the cooking side aswell as RootBeer making.
                    After we found out one day that we both had this same dream where there was this kinda like Rootbeer bar/cafe 
                    where people can hang out and play games and/or study at. We decided to team up and make this 
                    dream come true.
                    Now that it has, let me tell you what it is we offer here at the Happy Dragon.

                <img class="offering" src="images/root_beer_pending.jpg" alt="A sample of what we offer">
                <h2 class="offertitle">What we offer</h2>
                <p class="offertext">Here at the Happy Dragon, we offer a wide variety of baked goods and dishes as well as Root Beer. We love to share things that we make so feel free and come try some pastries and Root beer.
                    We also offer a place for all those D&D parties to meet and also give it a vibe of a tavern straight from their adventures. Not many places can really do that now can they?
                    We also have a place where if you need a nice place to do homework or study for a paper. We know there is not a lot of good places nowadays for kids to go and do their homework, and lets face it, sometimes home and the library just cant provide the required space. If you DO need help with your H.W. however, we will do our best to help you get that A grade.

                <h2 id="notitle">What we dont allow</h2>
                <p class="notext">Now, here are some things we just wont allow. NO ALCHLOHOL. This is a family safe space so of course NO SMOKING either.
                    If you are seen bullying others or causing problems for anyone, you will be kicked out and MAYBE, just maybe, we might let you come back. We strive to have a safe and peaceful space, we intend to keep it that way.
                    Now, if you and your group decides to do game night and wont clean up after yourselves or cause a huge mess and leave it, we are gonna have some words about your future game nights here. You still need to show respect for everyone else around you cause guess what, you are in public and not at home. That is all.
